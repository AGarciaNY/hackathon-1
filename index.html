        <p  class="hideme" style="text-indent: 50px;">
          Everyone knowns, global warming is bad, that is unless you'ver lived under a rock 
          for an unbelievable amount of time, to which you would be dead and not reading this.
          The primary causes for global warming being a problem is due to the properties of CO2. CO2 has
          the capacity to capture heat, thus turing our atmosphere into one that super heats the Earth( perhaps Super heat
          is too strong of a word).

        <p style="text-indent: 50px;">
          Everyone else also knows that there are an unbelievable amount of things in our daily lives that contribute to
          the ever amounting problem that is gloabl warming. These everyday objects consist of trash, such as plastic bags and 
          fumes emmited by cars and recyclables that are thrown away as trash. Of course thers's always those pesky aluminum 
          containers, to which take forever to decompose. As for how this affects the Earths overall climate, it primarily
          causes an increase in climate as in order to melt or decompose certain peices of trash. This melting or decomposition process 
          consumes massive amounts of energy, to which causes more fumes and more CO2 to be eposed into the air, thus we've come full circle.

        <p class="hideme" style="text-indent: 50px;">
          Climate change has different effects on many aspects of life, ranging from minor
          inconveniences (ie:decreasing salinity), to multigenerational disasters (ie: being
          cooked alive). The rise in sea level, for instance, will eventually flood entire 
          countries. The water shortages in drought-afflicted areas, will lead to wars over
          water. The heat will kill hundreds of thousands. There is some good news, like the improvments 
          in shipping that come as a result of melting ice, or the possibility of farming in 
          Siberia. But that good news is nothing compared to the suffering of millions that
          will come if climate change, and the issues surrounding it aren't adressed soon.

      <div id="solution">
        <h3 class="hideme">Solutions</h3>
        <p  class="hideme" style="text-indent: 50px;">
          Many have proposed various different solutions to this problem. Ideas range 
          from a 'Green New Deal', to cutting back on several modern luxuries that 
          pollute. They all seem to center around reducing the ammount pollutants
          that are pumped into the air, land, and water. There are many things that
          one can do in order to decrease the amount of pollutants that they produce.
          Those things include consuming less, recycling, and turning off faucets and
          lights, so that less energy is used.
